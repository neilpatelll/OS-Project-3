## Initial Thoughts
Starting my B-tree index file project today. I'm excited to build this data structure from scratch as it will help me better understand how database systems manage indexes on disk. B-trees are fascinating because they maintain balance while allowing for efficient operations, which is crucial for database performance.

## Goals for this Session
1. Set up the core infrastructure for the project
2. Implement fundamental binary I/O operations
3. Create the Node class structure to represent B-tree nodes
4. Develop a NodeCache with LRU behavior for memory management
5. Create functions to read and write nodes to disk
6. Implement file header management to track root and next available block

I'm planning to use fixed-size blocks (512 bytes) to store nodes, with binary serialization for efficiency. Each node will store keys, values, and child pointers with a B-tree degree of T=10.

## Challenges Anticipated
I expect the binary serialization to be tricky, especially ensuring that all the fields are correctly aligned. Memory management will also be a challenge - I need to ensure dirty nodes get written back when evicted from cache.

## Implementation Plan
1. First define constants and helper functions
2. Then implement Node class
3. Build NodeCache with LRU capabilities
4. Create header initialization and reading/writing functions
5. Test basic I/O operations

## Session Wrap-Up
I've completed the foundational work for the B-tree implementation. Here's what I accomplished:

1. Set up core data structures:
   - Created a Node class with fields for keys, values, children, and metadata
   - Implemented NodeCache with LRU eviction to manage memory usage
   - Added a "dirty" flag to track nodes needing writeback

2. Implemented binary I/O operations:
   - Created helpers for reading/writing 64-bit big-endian values
   - Built functions to serialize/deserialize nodes to/from disk blocks
   - Established node layout offsets for predictable storage

3. Added file header management:
   - Initialized header with magic number for file validation
   - Set up tracking for root node and next available block

The code now correctly manages disk-based storage of B-tree nodes. The NodeCache implementation should provide good performance by keeping recently used nodes in memory and properly writing back modified nodes.

## Challenges Encountered
I had to carefully think through the node layout to make sure everything fit within the 512-byte blocks. The binary serialization was tricky, especially with variable-length arrays like keys and children.

## Next Steps
For the next session, I'll implement the core B-tree operations:
1. Search functionality to find keys
2. Insert operations with node splitting
3. Handle the special case of root node splitting
